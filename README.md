1. Run the generate_fact_predicates file to generate the predicates generated by the facts in the dataset ( A generated predicate file has been provided)
2. Run the generate_qtemp file to generate the intermediate file ( A generated qtemp file has been provided)
3. Run the generate_ILASP file to generate the ILASP file. Download the ILASP file and run ILASP. (Modify the "index" variable in the generate_ILASP file to generate ILASP files for different problems, the index corresponds to the index of the qtemp file)

The experiment was run under Google Colab, the corresponding file path needs to be modified, also you need to download Standford-corenlp and specify its path
